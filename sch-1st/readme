The ESA-PINNs-PT model utilizes 1 or 3 partitions to maintain high accuracy in simulating first-order rogue waves.

8 tests are conducted to validate the robustness of ESA-PINNs-PT by varying the random seed, achieving an RL2 error of 
(3.98±1.35)e−5 for 1 partition simulation and (2.48±0.38)e−5 for 3 partition case.
